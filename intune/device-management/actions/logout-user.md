The *logout current user* device action in Microsoft Intune allows IT administrators to remotely sign out the active user from a Shared iPad. this action is useful in environments where multiple users access the same device throughout the day. Logging out the current user helps maintain privacy, ensures session cleanup, and prepares the device for the next user—supporting secure and efficient device turnover in shared-use scenarios.
