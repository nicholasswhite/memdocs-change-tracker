# Device action: BitLocker key rotation

The *BitLocker key rotation* action in Microsoft Intune lets IT admins remotely refresh the recovery key for the operating system drive on BitLocker-encrypted Windows devices. This helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access if a recovery key has been used or potentially exposed.

Key rotation is especially useful in environments where devices are frequently serviced, reassigned, or exposed to support scenarios. For example, if a helpdesk technician shares a recovery key during a support call, you can rotate the key from Intune to ensure it can't be reused.
