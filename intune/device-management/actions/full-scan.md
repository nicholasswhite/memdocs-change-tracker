# Device action: full scan

The *full scan* action in Intune lets IT admins trigger a comprehensive malware scan on managed Windows devices using Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It checks all files and running processes, helping detect threats missed by quick scans.

This action is ideal when a device is suspected of compromise or when validating security baselines. Instead of waiting for scheduled scans or relying on user action, admins can launch a full scan directly from the Intune admin center.
