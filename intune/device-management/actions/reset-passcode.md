# Device action: reset passcode

## Passcode reset types

When working with Android devices, it's important to understand the two types of passcode resets available:

- **Device-level passcode reset**: The action resets the passcode for the entire device.
- **Work profile passcode reset**: The action resets the passcode for the user's work profile only.

The following table summarizes the passcode reset types based on platform:

| Platform | Device-level passcode reset | Work profile passcode reset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android Enterprise corporate-owned dedicated (COSU) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Android Enterprise corporate-owned fully managed (COBO) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile (COPE) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Android Enterprise personally-owned work profile (BYOD) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Android Open Source Project (AOSP) | ✅ | ❌ |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Before initiating a passcode reset, ensure that the passcode requirement is enforced via [device configuration policies](../../device-configuration/settings-catalog/ref-android-settings.md)—otherwise, the reset fails.

## How to reset a passcode from the Intune admin center

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select [**Devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/%7E/overview) &gt; [**All devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/%7E/allDevices).
2. From the devices list, select a device.
3. At the top of the device overview pane, find the row of action icons. Select **Secure** &gt; **Reset passcode**.
4. A new passcode is presented to the admin.

The new passcode must be entered on the device, and it's displayed in the admin center for seven days.

## User experience

For work profile passcode reset, users get notified to activate their reset passcode. After their passcode is entered, the notification is dismissed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If the remote lock action fails, confirm that you have a device passcode policy assigned to the device. If the device doesn't have a device passcode assigned, the remote lock action doesn't succeed.
