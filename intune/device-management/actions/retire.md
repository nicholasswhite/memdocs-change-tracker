# Device action: retire

The *retire* action in Intune removes company data from a device without performing a full wipe or factory reset. This action is ideal for personally owned devices or when transitioning a device out of organizational control. It unenrolls the device from Intune and removes managed apps, settings, and profiles deployed through mobile device management (MDM), while preserving personal data.

Unlike the **Wipe** action, which resets the device to factory settings, **Retire** keeps user content intact. The action is triggered the next time the device checks in with Intune. Until then, the device might still appear in the admin center. If you need to remove a device immediately, consider using the [delete device action](delete.md) instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> A tenant can submit up to 1,000 Retire actions per day. This tenant-wide limit is cumulative across individual device actions, bulk device actions, and Microsoft Graph API requests. To request a limit change, [contact Microsoft support](../../fundamentals/it-pro-support/get-support-admin-center.md). For all device action limits, see [Daily tenant limits](index.md#daily-tenant-limits).

## Before retiring or deleting a Microsoft Entra joined device

If you delete or retire the Intune object for a Microsoft Entra joined device that is protected by BitLocker, Intune triggers a sync that removes key protectors. This action suspends BitLocker on the OS volume as a safeguard to prevent unrecoverable encryption scenarios when the Entra object is deleted.

Before retiring a Microsoft Entra joined device, make sure to back up any critical data that may be lost during the process, such as:

- BitLocker recovery key
- Local administrator account credentials

## How to retire a device from the Intune admin center

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select [**Devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/%7E/overview) &gt; [**All devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/%7E/allDevices).
2. From the devices list, select a device.
3. At the top of the device overview pane, find the row of action icons. Select **Remove data** &gt; **Retire**. To confirm, select **Yes**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This action might be governed by an Intune access policy that requires Multiple Administrative Approval (MAA). If so, a second administrator must approve the action before it can proceed.
>
> For more information, see [Use access policies to require multiple administrative approvals](../../fundamentals/role-based-access-control/multi-admin-approval.md).

## User experience

When you use the **Retire** device action, the user's personal data isn't removed from the device.

::: zone pivot="ios"

The following table shows what data is removed and what remains on the device after the action is applied.

| Data type | iOS |
| --- | --- |
| Company apps and associated data installed by Intune | **Apps installed using Company Portal:** For apps that are pinned to the management profile, all app data and the apps are removed. These apps include apps originally installed from App Store and later managed as company apps unless the app is configured to not be uninstalled on device removal.    **Microsoft apps that use App Protection Policies and were installed from App Store:** Intune triggers a selective wipe (see [Wipe only corporate data from apps](../../app-management/protection/wipe-corporate-data.md)) for apps protected by an App Protection Policy (see [App protection policies overview](../../app-management/protection/overview.md)) when a Retire action is initiated against an enrolled device. This wipe includes apps installed from the App Store that have work or school account data. The next time the app is launched, the selective wipe removes the protected work or school account data. In order for the selective wipe to occur, an App Protection Policy check-in must occur between the MDM enrollment and retire events. Personal app data and the apps aren't removed after a selective wipe. |
| Settings | Configurations set by Intune policy are no longer enforced. Users can change the settings. |
| Wi-Fi and VPN profile settings | Removed. |
| Certificate profile settings | Certificates are removed and revoked. |
| Management agent | The management profile is removed. |
| Email | Email profiles that are provisioned through Intune are removed. Cached email on the device is deleted. |
| Microsoft Entra device record | The Microsoft Entra ID record isn't removed. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> Users that reinstall the Outlook Mobile app following a **Retire** device action might need to choose to **Delete All Saved Contacts** before re-exporting contacts to avoid duplicate contact entries. Previously exported contacts from Outlook Mobile are considered personal data and are not removed by the **Retire** device action.

### Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

Removing company data from an Android personally owned work profile device removes all data, apps, and settings in the work profile on that device.

### Android device administrator

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Android device administrator (DA) management is deprecated and no longer available for devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS). If you currently use DA management, we recommend switching to another Android management option. Support and help documentation remain available for some Android 15 and earlier devices without GMS. For more information, see [Ending support for Android device administrator on GMS devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/microsoft-intune-ending-support-for-android-device-administrator/ba-p/3915443).

## Remove a device from Microsoft Entra ID

After executing the action on a device from Intune, you might also want to remove its record from Microsoft Entra ID to fully disconnect it from your organization's identity infrastructure. This step helps ensure that the device no longer appears in your tenant, avoids potential confusion in device inventory, and prevents lingering access permissions or stale records that could affect compliance or reporting.

For more information about removing devices from Microsoft Entra ID, see [Manage stale devices in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/manage-stale-devices).

1. Go to [business.apple.com](http://business.apple.com), navigate to the **Devices** section, and search for the device using its serial number.
2. Select the device, opent the **...** menu, and the select **Release from Organization**.
3. Confirm the action by checking **I understand this cannot be undone**, and then select **Continue**.

> [!NOTE]
