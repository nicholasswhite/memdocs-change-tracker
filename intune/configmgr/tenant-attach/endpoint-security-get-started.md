# Get started: Create and deploy endpoint security policies from the admin center

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The Microsoft Intune family of products is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Intune admin center**.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](device-sync-actions.md).
- A supported version of Configuration Manager and the corresponding version of the console installed.
  - Upgrade the target devices to the latest version of the Configuration Manager client.
- At least one Configuration Manager collection that's [available for assigning Endpoint security policies](#bkmk_collections)
- Windows Devices that [support this profile for tenant attached devices](#bkmk_supportedprofiles)

## Supported endpoint security profiles for tenant attached devices

## Make Configuration Manager collections available to assign Endpoint security policies

When you enable collections of devices to work with endpoint security policies from Intune, you're configuring devices in those collections to onboard with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

1. From a Configuration Manager console connected to your top-level site, right-click on a device collection that you synchronize to Microsoft Intune admin center and select **Properties**.
2. On the **Cloud Sync** tab, enable the option to **Make this collection available to assign Endpoint security policies from Microsoft Intune admin center**.

   - You can't select this option if your Configuration Manager hierarchy isn't tenant attached.
   - The collections available for this option are limited by the [collection scope selected for tenant attach upload](device-sync-actions.md#bkmk_edit).

   ![Configure cloud sync](../../fundamentals/media/tenant-attach/cloud-sync.png)
3. Select **Add** and then select the Microsoft Entra group that you would like to synchronize with **Collect membership results**.
4. Select **OK** to save the configuration.

   Devices in this collection can now onboard with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and support use of Intune endpoint security policies.
