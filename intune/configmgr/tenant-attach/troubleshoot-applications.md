# Troubleshoot application installation for devices uploaded to the admin center

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Use the following to troubleshoot Configuration Manager applications in the Microsoft Intune admin center:

## Common errors from the Microsoft Intune admin center

When viewing or installing applications from the Microsoft Intune admin center, you may run across one of these errors.

### You don’t have access to view this information

**Error message:** You don’t have access to view this information. Make sure a proper user role is assigned from Intune.

**Possible cause:** The user account needs an [Intune role](../../fundamentals/role-based-access-control/overview.md) assigned. In some cases, this error may also occur during replication of information and it resolves without intervention after a few minutes.

### Unable to get application information

**Error message 1:** Unable to get application information. Make sure Microsoft Entra ID and AD user discovery are configured and the user is discovered by both. Verify that the user has proper permissions in Configuration Manager.

**Possible causes:** Typically, this error is caused by an issue with the admin account. Below are the most common issues with the administrative user account:

1. Use the same account to sign in to the admin center. The on-premises identity must be synchronized with and match the cloud identity.
2. Verify the account has **Read** permission for the device's **Collection** in Configuration Manager.
3. Make sure that Configuration Manager has discovered the administrative user account you're using to access the tenant attach features within Microsoft Intune admin center. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace. Select the **Users** node, and find your user account.

   If your account isn't listed in the **Users** node, check the configuration of the site's [Active Directory User discovery](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser).
4. Verify the discovery data. Select your user account. In the ribbon, on the **Home** tab select **Properties**. In the properties window, confirm the following discovery data:

   - **Microsoft Entra tenant ID**: This value should be a GUID for the Microsoft Entra tenant.
   - **Microsoft Entra user ID**: This value should be a GUID for this account in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - **User Principal Name**: The format of this value is user@domain. For example, `jqpublic@contoso.com`.

   If the Microsoft Entra properties are empty, check the configuration of the site's [Microsoft Entra user discovery](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc).

### Unexpected error occurred

**Error message:** Unexpected error occurred

#### Error code 500 with an unexpected error occurred message

1. If you see `System.Security.SecurityException` in the **AdminService.log**, verify that your user principal name (UPN) discovered by [Active Directory User discovery](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser) isn't set to a cloud UPN rather than an on-premises UPN. An empty UPN value is also acceptable as it means the Active Directory discovered domain name is used. If you see cloud-only UPN (example: onmicrosoft.com) that's not valid domain UPN (contoso.com), you have an issue and may need to go [set the UPN suffix in Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/prepare-a-non-routable-domain-for-directory-synchronization#add-upn-suffixes-and-update-your-users-to-them).
2. Install [KB4576782 - Application blade times out in Microsoft Intune admin center](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4576782) if you see the below error in the **AdminService.log**:

   ```log
   System.Data.Entity.Core.EntityCommandExecutionException: An error occurred while executing the command definition. See the inner exception for details.
   System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Execution Timeout Expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.
   System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The wait operation timed out
   ```

#### Error code 3 with an unexpected error occurred message

The Admin Service isn't running or IIS isn't installed. IIS must be installed on provider machine. For more information, see [Prerequisites for the administration service](../develop/adminservice/overview.md#prerequisites).

#### Other possible causes of unexpected errors

Unexpected errors are typically caused by either [service connection point](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md), [administration service](../develop/adminservice/overview.md), or connectivity issues.

1. Verify the service connection point has connectivity to the cloud using the **CMGatewayNotificationWorker.log**.
2. Verify the administrative service is healthy by reviewing the SMS_REST_PROVIDER component from site component monitoring on the central site.
3. IIS must be installed on provider machine. For more information, see [Prerequisites for the administration service](../develop/adminservice/overview.md#prerequisites).

### The site information hasn't yet synchronized

**Error message:** The site information hasn't yet synchronized from Configuration Manager to the Microsoft Intune admin center. Wait up to 15 minutes after you attach the site to your Azure tenant.

**Possible causes:**

- This error typically occurs when newly onboarding to tenant attach. Wait up to an hour for the information to synchronize.
- This error may also appear if the central administration site has been upgraded to a new Configuration Manager version but some child primary sites haven't been upgraded yet.

### Application shows as installed after creating a new deployment

**Symptom:** An application is shown as installed in the Microsoft Intune admin center after creating a new device available requires approval deployment or a user available deployment.

**Possible cause:** The application state shown for that device is from another active or past deployment.

### Errors when searching or retrying an installation

**Symptom:** Errors occur when performing the following actions:

- Use search
- Select **Retry installation**

**Possible cause:** Ensure that a supported version of Configuration Manager is installed. For more information, see [prerequisites for installing an application from the admin center](applications.md#prerequisites).

## Known issues

### When the Configuration Manager site is configured to require multi-factor authentication, most tenant attach features don't work

**Scenario:** If the [SMS provider](../core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider.md) machine that communicates with the [service connection point](../core/servers/deploy/configure/about-the-service-connection-point.md) is configured to use multi-factor authentication, you can't install applications, run CMPivot queries, and perform other actions from the admin console. You receive an error code 403, forbidden.

**Workaround:** The current workaround is to configure the on-premises hierarchy to the default authentication level of **Windows authentication**. For more information, see the [Authentication section in the SMS provider article](../core/plan-design/hierarchy/plan-for-the-sms-provider.md#authentication).
