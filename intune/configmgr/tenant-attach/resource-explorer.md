# Tenant attach: Resource explorer in the admin center

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

The Microsoft Intune family of products is an integrated solution for managing all of your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune into a single console called **Microsoft Intune admin center**. From the Microsoft Endpoint Management admin center, you can view hardware inventory for uploaded Configuration Manager devices by using resource explorer.
