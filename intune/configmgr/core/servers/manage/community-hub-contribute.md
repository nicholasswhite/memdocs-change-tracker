# Contribute to the Community hub

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Starting in March 2023, this feature of Configuration Manager is being removed. All future versions, starting with 2303 will not have the Community hub node in the admin console. The Community hub node in older versions will be redirected to [deprecated features](../../plan-design/changes/deprecated/removed-and-deprecated-cmfeatures.md).

[Community hub](community-hub.md) fosters creativity by building on others work and having other people build on yours. GitHub already has industry-wide processes and tools built for sharing. Now, the Community hub can leverage those tools directly in the Configuration Manager console as foundational pieces for driving this new community. You can share the following objects for use by others in the Configuration Manager community:

- CMPivot queries
- Applications
- Task sequences
- Configuration items
- Configuration baselines, including child configuration items
  - Baselines with software updates or version-specific references aren't supported
- PowerShell Scripts
- Reports
- Power BI report templates
  - For information about sharing and using Power BI report templates with Community hub, see [Integrate with Power BI Report Server](powerbi-report-server.md#bkmk_community_hub).
- [Console extensions](community-hub-extensions.md) are available for download, but contributions are currently limited
  - Content for console extensions isn't hosted by Microsoft. Currently, the source download location displays in the [verbose SmsAdminUi.log](../../plan-design/hierarchy/about-log-files.md#configuration-manager-console-logging-options) for the console that initiates the download.

## Prerequisites

- All [Community hub prerequisites and permissions](community-hub.md#prerequisites)
- Configuration Manager version 2010 or later
- Install the Microsoft Edge [WebView2 extension](community-hub.md#bkmk_webview2) for the Configuration Manager console.
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
  - A GitHub account is only required to contribute and share content from the **Your hub** page.
  - If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can create one before you join.
  - If you don't wish to share, you can use contributions from others without having a GitHub account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Configuration Manager versions 2006 and earlier can’t sign in to GitHub but can still download items. Using Community hub on Windows Server requires the WebView2 console extension and Configuration Manager version 2010 or later.

Most [built-in security roles](../../understand/fundamentals-of-role-based-administration.md) will have access to the **Community hub** node:

| Role name | View the hub | Contribute hub content | Download hub content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remote Tools Operator | No | N/A | N/A |
| Read Only Analyst | Yes | No | No |
| All other roles | Yes | Yes | Yes |

2. From the item you want to delete, select **Delete** in the far-right column.

Method 2:   
   
 If the pull request was never completed (merged) into the GitHub repository, then you can just close the pull request. Ensure that you're signed in to GitHub with the same GitHub account that you used to create the pull request.

## Personalization and organization branding of contributed content

Starting in January 2021, your contributions are personalized. By default, your contributions include your personal GitHub profile picture. The default [GitHub Identicon](https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons/) is used if you don't have a profile picture. All contributions you've submitted before January 2021 are automatically personalized using this default.

![Public profile contribution screenshot](media/8928812-contribution-personalized.png)

Community hub also allows new contributions to be branded instead of using the default personalization. You can brand a contribution to one of your organization memberships in GitHub that's publicly visible. When you choose to brand your contribution, the organization's profile picture is used rather than your personal profile picture. The organization's web page, Twitter handle, and company bio are included on the contribution. Branding to the organization identity allows for uniformity regardless of which user is submitting the contribution.

![Branded contribution screenshot](media/8928812-contribution-branded.png)

To use branding:

- The [visibility of the organization membership](https://docs.github.com/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership) must be set to **Public** from the contributor's GitHub profile.
- On the **Organization** page in the **Contribute item wizard**, select the **GitHub Organization** to use for branding. For more information, see the [Contribute content](#contribute-content) section.

## Directly link to Community hub items

*(Introduced in version 2006)*

You can navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console **Community hub** node with a direct link. Collaborate with your colleagues easily by sharing direct links to Community hub items. These deep links are currently only for items in the **Community hub** node of the console.

Prerequisites for direct links:

- Configuration Manager console version 2006 or later

Share an item:

1. Go the item in the hub and select **Share**.
2. Paste the copied link and share it with others.

Open a shared link:

1. Open the link from a machine that has the Configuration Manager console installed.
2. Select **Launch the Community hub** when prompted.
3. The console opens directly to the script in the **Community hub** node.

## Publish query to Community hub from CMPivot

*(Applies to version 2107 or later)*

Starting in version 2107, you can publish a CMPivot query to the Community hub directly from the CMPivot window. Submitting your queries directly through CMPivot makes contributing to the Community hub easier.

You'll need the following requirements for CMPivot and for contributing to the Community hub:

- Meet all of the [CMPivot prerequisites and permissions](cmpivot.md#prerequisites)
- Enable [Community hub](community-hub.md).
  - If needed, install the Microsoft Edge WebView2 extension from the [Configuration Manager console notification](community-hub.md#bkmk_webview2).
- A GitHub account that's [joined to Community hub](#join-the-community-hub-to-contribute-content)
  - You must accept the invitation sent in the email otherwise you won't be able to contribute content.

1. Go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace then select the **Device Collections** node.
2. Select a target collection, target device, or group of devices then select **Start CMPivot** in the ribbon to launch the tool.
3. From the CMPivot window, select the Community hub icon on the menu.

   ![Community hub icon](media/7137169-hub-icon.png)
4. Select **Sign in**, then sign in to GitHub.
5. Create a CMPivot query, then select **Run Query** to verify it functions as expected.

   - Optionally, select the folder icon to access your favorites list to use a query you've already created.
6. Select the **Publish** link at top of CMPivot's Community hub window when you're ready to submit your query.

   ![Screenshot of the Community hub window in CMPivot showing the publishing tab](media/9965423-publish.png)
7. Give your query a **Name** and **Description**, then select the **Publish** button to send your query to the Community hub.
8. Once the contribution is complete, you can access your query anytime from the **Me** tab.
9. To view the GitHub pull request (PR), go to <https://github.com/Microsoft/configmgr-hub/pulls>. You can also access the PR link from the **Your hub** page in the **Community hub** node.

   - PRs shouldn't be submitted directly to the GitHub repository.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Currently, when you publish a query through CMPivot, you can't edit or delete it after publishing.
> - Community hub is only available in CMPivot when you run it from the Configuration Manager console. Community hub isn't available from [standalone CMPivot](cmpivot.md#install-cmpivot-standalone).

## Object type information

### Configuration baselines

When you contribute a [configuration baseline](../../../compliance/deploy-use/create-configuration-baselines.md), each of the child configuration items is verified. The verification starts at the lowest nested level. This means that configuration items that are grandchildren are verified before direct child configuration items are. You can have up to 50 child configuration items and up to 4 nested levels. The following process occurs to ensure the configuration baseline is usable and complete:

1. Check if the child configuration item is already in the Community hub. If the configuration item doesn't exist, it's created.
   - A configuration item with software updates or version-specific references will cause an error and the contribution will fail.
2. If the configuration item already exists in the Community hub, verify the contributor is the author. If the contributor isn't the author, a new configuration item is created in Community hub.
3. If the contributor is the author, check for local updates to the configuration item. If the configuration item changed, update the item in the Community hub.

### Console extensions

You contribute extensions the same way you would any other community hub object. However, for there are additional requirements and additional information you need to supply for an extension. When you contribute a console extension to Community hub, the content must be signed. Content for console extensions isn't hosted by Microsoft. When you contribute your item, you'll be asked to provide a location to the signed `.cab` file along with other information for the extension. The following items are required for contributing extensions:

- **Content URL**: Location for the downloadable `.cab` file
- **SHA-256 hash of the content**: SHA-256 hash of the `.cab` file
- **License URL**: URL of the license for the extension, such as <https://mit-license.org/>
- **Privacy statement URL**: URL of your privacy statement
