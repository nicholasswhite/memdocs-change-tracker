# Supported OS versions for clients and devices for Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

Configuration Manager supports installing client software on Windows computers.

## General requirements and limitations

Review the following requirements and limitations for all clients:

- Changing the startup type or **Log on as** settings for any Configuration Manager service isn't supported. This change can prevent key services from running correctly.

## Windows computers

To manage the following Windows OS versions, use the client that's included with Configuration Manager. For more information, see [How to deploy clients to Windows computers](../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers.md).

### Supported client OS versions

- **Windows 11** (*starting in Configuration Manager version 2107*)

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > You can continue to use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage devices running Windows 11 the same as with Windows 10. For more information, including some known issues, see [Support for Windows 11](support-for-windows-11.md).
- **Windows 10**

  For more information, see [Support for Windows 10](support-for-windows-10.md).

For more information on the versions of the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) that Configuration Manager current branch supports, see [Support for the Windows ADK](support-for-windows-adk.md).

#### Azure Virtual Desktop

[Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/) is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on Microsoft Azure. You can use Configuration Manager to manage these virtual devices running Windows in Azure.

Similar to a terminal server, some of these virtual devices allow multiple concurrent active user sessions. To help with client performance, Configuration Manager disables user policies on any device that allows these multiple user sessions. Even if you enable user policies, the client disables them by default on these devices, which include Windows Enterprise multi-session and terminal servers.

The client only disables user policy when it detects this type of device during a new installation. For an existing client of this type that you update to this version, the previous behavior persists. On an existing device, it configures the user policy setting even if it detects that the device allows multiple user sessions.

If you require user policy in this scenario, and accept any potential performance impact, use [client settings](../../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md) to enable user policy. In the **Client Policy** group, configure the following setting: **Enable user policy for multiple user sessions**.

Starting in version 2006, the **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session** platform is available in the list of supported OS versions on objects with requirement rules or applicability lists. Starting in version 2107, the **Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session** platform is available.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you previously selected the top-level platform, this action automatically selected all child platforms. New platforms aren't automatically selected. For example, if you want to add **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session**, manually select it under the **Windows 10** platform.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Support for virtualization environments](support-for-virtualization-environments.md)
- [Manage Configuration Manager clients in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)](../../clients/deploy/plan/considerations-for-managing-clients-in-a-vdi.md)

### Supported server OS versions

#### Note 1

To support [client push installation](../../clients/deploy/plan/client-installation-methods.md#client-push-installation), add the File Server service of the File and Storage Services server role. For more information about installing Windows features on Server Core, see [Install roles, role services, and features by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/server-manager/install-or-uninstall-roles-role-services-or-features#install-roles-role-services-and-features-by-using-windows-powershell-cmdlets).

#### Note 2

The Software Center app isn't supported on any version of Windows Server Core.

## Windows Embedded computers

Manage Windows Embedded devices by installing the Configuration Manager client on the device. For more information, see [Planning for client deployment to Windows Embedded devices](../../clients/deploy/plan/planning-for-client-deployment-to-windows-embedded-devices.md).

## Extended Security Updates and Configuration Manager

The [Extended Security Updates (ESU)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates) program is a last resort option for customers who need to run certain legacy Microsoft products past the end of support. For example, Windows 10. It includes Critical and/or Important security updates (as defined by the [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc)) for a maximum of three years after the product's End of Extended Support date.

Products that are beyond their support lifecycle aren't supported for use with Configuration Manager. This includes any products that are covered under the ESU program. Security updates released under the ESU program will be published to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). These updates will appear in the Configuration Manager console. While ESU-covered products are not supported operating systems in Configuration Manager<sup>[1](#clarification1)</sup>, a [supported version of Configuration Manager current branch](../../servers/manage/updates.md#version-details) can be used to deploy and install ESU security updates for supported **Windows 10** editions<sup>[2](#clarification2)</sup>. For details, see the [Extended Security Updates FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates). No further support is offered for computers running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008/2008 R2, including customers with an additional year of ESU support as noted in [KB4522133](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb4522133-procedure-to-continue-receiving-security-updates-after-extended-support-ended-on-january-10-2023-48c59204-fe67-3f42-84fc-c3c3145ff28e).

Starting in Configuration Manager version 2609, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and their Windows Storage Server editions are no longer supported as client operating systems.

Client management features not related to Windows software update management or OS deployment will no longer be tested on the operating systems covered under the ESU program and we don't guarantee that they'll continue to function. It's highly recommended to upgrade or migrate to a current version of the operating systems as soon as possible to receive client management support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **1.** "Not Supported" means these operating systems are not considered supported platforms for all general features of Configuration Manager.
>
> The only supported scenarios are:
>
> - Deployment of ESU security updates.
> - For ESU-enabled Windows 10 devices, upgrade to Windows 11 via a Windows 11 Feature Update.
> - For any Windows 10 device, upgrade to Windows 11 via Microsoft Configuration Manager Operating System Deployment (OSD).
>
> **2.** If ConfigMgr product fixes are required for ESU functionality, they will only be made available in the latest released version of Configuration Manager current branch and will not be backported to earlier supported versions.

> [!TIP]
>
> Starting in Configuration Manager 2010, you'll be notified in-console about devices with operating systems that are past the end of support date and that are no longer eligible to receive security updates. For more information, see [Console notifications](../../servers/manage/admin-console-notifications.md#bkmk_2010). This information is provided for your convenience and only for use internally within your company. You should not solely rely on this information to confirm update or license compliance. Be sure to verify the accuracy of the information provided to you.
