# Capabilities in Configuration Manager technical preview version 1809

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 1809. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

  

**The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:**

## Improvements to CMPivot

CMPivot includes the following improvements:

- [Scalar functions](#bkmk_cmpivot-functions)
- [Rendering visualizations](#bkmk_cmpivot-charts)
- [Hardware inventory](#bkmk_cmpivot-hinv)
- [Scalar operators](#bkmk_cmpivot-operators)
- [Query summary](#bkmk_cmpivot-summary)

For more general information, see [CMPivot](../servers/manage/cmpivot.md).

### Scalar functions

CMPivot supports the following scalar functions:

- **ago()**: Subtracts the given timespan from the current UTC clock time
- **datetime_diff()**: Calculates the calendar difference between two datetime values
- **now()**: Returns the current UTC clock time
- **bin()**: Rounds values down to an integer multiple of a given bin size

> [!NOTE]
>
> The datetime data type represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day. Time values are measured in 1-second units. A datetime value is always in the UTC time zone. Always express date time literals in ISO 8601 format, for example, `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:ss`

#### Examples

- `datetime(2015-12-31 23:59:59.9)`: A specific date time literal
- `now()`: The current time
- `ago(1d)`: The current time minus one day

### Rendering visualizations

CMPivot now includes basic support for the Log Analytics [render operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/query/renderoperator). This support includes the following types:

- **barchart**: First column is x-axis, and can be text, datetime or numeric. The second columns must be numeric and is displayed as a horizontal strip.
- **columnchart**: Like barchart, with vertical strips instead of horizontal strips.
- **piechart**: First column is color-axis, second column is numeric.
- **timechart**: Line graph. First column is x-axis, and should be datetime. Second column is y-axis.

#### Example: bar chart

The following query renders the most recently used applications as a bar chart:

```Kusto
CCMRecentlyUsedApplications
| summarize dcount( Device ) by ProductName
| top 10 by dcount_
| render barchart
```

#### Example: time chart

To render time charts, use the new **bin()** operator to group events in time. The following query shows when devices have started in the last seven days:

```Kusto
OperatingSystem
| where LastBootUpTime <= ago(7d)
| summarize count() by bin(LastBootUpTime,1d)
| render timechart
```

![Example of CMPivot time chart visualization](media/1359068-cmpivot-timechart.png)

#### Example: pie chart

The following query displays all OS versions in a pie chart:

```Kusto
OperatingSystem
| summarize count() by Caption
| render piechart
```

### Hardware inventory

Use CMPivot to query any hardware inventory class. These classes include any custom extensions you make to hardware inventory. CMPivot immediately returns cached results from the last hardware inventory scan stored in the site database. At the same time, it updates the results if necessary with live data from any online clients.

The color saturation of the data in the results table or chart indicates if the data is live or cached. For example, dark blue is real-time data from an online client. Light blue is cached data.

#### Example

```Kusto
LogicalDisk
| summarize sum( FreeSpace ) by Device
| order by sum_ desc
| render columnchart
```

#### Limitations

- The following hardware inventory entities aren't supported:
  - Array properties, for example IP address
  - Real32/Real64
  - Embedded object properties
- Inventory entity names must begin with a character
- You can't overwrite the built-in entities by creating an inventory entity of the same name

### Scalar operators

Based on your feedback, CMPivot includes the following scalar operators:

> [!NOTE]
>
> - LHS: string to the left of the operator
> - RHS: string to the right of the operator

| Operator | Description | Example (yields true) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equals | `"aBc" == "aBc"` |
| != | Not equals | `"abc" != "ABC"` |
| like | LHS contains a match for RHS | `"FabriKam" like "%Brik%"` |
| !like | LHS doesn't contain a match for RHS | `"Fabrikam" !like "%xyz%"` |
| contains | RHS occurs as a subsequence of LHS | `"FabriKam" contains "BRik"` |
| !contains | RHS doesn't occur in LHS | `"Fabrikam" !contains "xyz"` |
| startswith | RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS | `"Fabrikam" startswith "fab"` |
| !startswith | RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS | `"Fabrikam" !startswith "kam"` |
| endswith | RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS | `"Fabrikam" endswith "Kam"` |
| !endswith | RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS | `"Fabrikam" !endswith "brik"` |

### Query summary

Select the **Query Summary** tab at the bottom of the CMPivot window. This status helps you identify clients that are offline, or troubleshoot errors that may occur. Select a value in the Count column to open a list of specific devices with that status.

For example, select the count of devices with a Failure status. See the specific error message, and export a list of these devices. If the error is that a specific cmdlet isn't recognized, create a collection from the exported device list to deploy a Windows PowerShell update.

## Improvement to lifecycle dashboard

The product lifecycle dashboard now includes information for **System Center 2012 Configuration Manager and later**. For more information on this dashboard, see [Use the Product Lifecycle dashboard](../clients/manage/asset-intelligence/product-lifecycle-dashboard.md).

## Improvement to data warehouse

Based on your feedback, you can now synchronize more tables from the site database to the [data warehouse](../servers/manage/data-warehouse.md). This change allows you to create more reports based on your business requirements.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace. Expand **Site Configuration**, and select the **Servers and Site System Roles** node.
2. Select the site system with the data warehouse service point role. In the Site System Roles pane at the bottom, select the **Data Warehouse service point** role. In the ribbon on the Site Role tab, select **Properties**.
3. Switch to the **Synchronization Settings** tab. Select the option to **Select tables**.
4. In the Database tables window, select the table names to synchronize to the data warehouse database. Use the filter to search by name, or select the drop-down list to choose specific groups.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > You can't remove tables that the role selects by default.

## Improvement to maintenance windows for software updates

If a device has more than one maintenance window applied, the client may ignore some windows.

For example:

- All deployment maintenance window: 02:00 - 04:00
- Software updates maintenance window: 04:00 - 06:00

The client only installs software updates during the second maintenance window. It ignores the maintenance window for all deployments in this scenario.

Starting in this technical preview version, the following client setting is in the **Software Updates** group to control this behavior:

**Enable installation of updates in "All deployments" maintenance window when "Software update" maintenance window is available**

By default, this option is **No** to keep consistent with the existing behavior. Change it to **Yes** to allow clients to use other available maintenance windows to install software updates.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [How to configure client settings](../clients/deploy/configure-client-settings.md)
- [How to use maintenance windows](../clients/manage/collections/use-maintenance-windows.md)
