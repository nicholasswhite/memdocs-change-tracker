# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2111

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 2111. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

## Improvements to the Windows servicing dashboard

We now display a **Windows 11 Latest Feature Updates** chart in the **Windows Servicing** dashboard. The new chart makes it easier to determine how many of your Windows 11 clients are on the latest feature update. To display the dashboard, go to **Software Library** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Windows Servicing**.

## Co-management Eligible Devices collection

There's a new built-in device collection for **Co-management Eligible Devices**. The **Co-management Eligible Devices** collection uses incremental updates and a daily full update to keep the collection up to date.

## Improvement to app groups

This release resolves one of the [known issues for app groups from version 2110](technical-preview-2110.md#bkmk_appgroups). View and managing app groups in the Microsoft Intune admin center doesn't require an elevated role. It honors permissions and scopes as defined in Configuration Manager. For example, your user account requires the **Approve** permission on an app group to approve it for installation from the admin center. This behavior is consistent with applications.

## Improvement to task sequence deployment type

Consider the following scenario:

- An application has a [task sequence deployment type](../../../apps/get-started/creating-windows-applications.md#bkmk_tsdt).
- It's deployed as available.
- A device has maintenance windows defined.
- A user on the device runs the deployment in Software Center outside of a maintenance window.

Configuration Manager honors the user's intent to install the application, even though there's no available maintenance window. Previously, when the task sequence ran, the **Restart Computer** step would fail because of the maintenance window.

Based on your feedback, this step now ignores maintenance windows only when the task sequence is run as an app deployment type.

## PowerShell release notes preview

These release notes summarize changes to the Configuration Manager PowerShell cmdlets in this technical preview release.

For more information about PowerShell for Configuration Manager, see [Get started with Configuration Manager cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sccm/overview).

### New cmdlets for orchestration groups

#### Invoke-CMOrchestrationGroup

Use this cmdlet to [start orchestration](../../../sum/deploy-use/create-orchestration-groups.md#start-orchestration).
