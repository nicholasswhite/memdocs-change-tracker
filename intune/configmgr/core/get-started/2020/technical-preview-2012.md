# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2012

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 2012. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

## Windows 10 Servicing dashboard changes

We’ve simplified the Windows 10 Servicing dashboard to make it more relevant. The new **Quality Update Versions** chart displays the top five revisions of Windows 10 across your devices. The **Latest Feature Update** chart shows the number of devices that installed the latest feature update. The **Windows 10 Usage** chart, showing the distribution of Windows 10 major releases, was renamed to **Feature Update Versions**. Servicing plan and Windows 10 ring information were removed from the dashboard.

### Known issues

When a build's revision number is three digits long, you may notice an extraneous dot before the build number in the **Quality Update Versions** chart. When one of these builds from the chart is selected, the temporary node displaying devices with the build will be empty.

## Tenant Attach: Application details

When [tenant attach](../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md) is enabled, the applications pane in the Microsoft Intune admin center will show an **Error Description** if the application status is **Failed**. For more information on the error code and troubleshooting steps, see [Application installation common error codes reference](../../../tenant-attach/app-install-error-reference.md).

## Get console extensions from the Community hub

The [Community hub](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md) now supports sharing extensions to the Configuration Manager console. When you get an extension from the hub, it's available in a new **Console extensions** node in the console. Getting an extension from the hub doesn't make it immediately available. First, an administrator has to approve the extension for the site. Then console users can install the extension to their local console.

After you approve an extension, when you open the console, you'll see a [console notification](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_webview2). From the notification, you can start the extension installer. After the installer completes, the console restarts automatically, and then you can use the extension.

### Console extension to show all status messages for a task sequence deployment

With this release, the Community hub includes one extension to help you test and use this feature: `Show all status messages for a task sequence deployment`. This extension is based on your feedback. When you install this extension, it adds a right-click action to task sequence deployments to **Show all status messages**.

![Context menu on a task sequence deployment with extension to Show all status messages](media/8116426-ts-deployment-menu.png)

To share a console extension with the community, use the same process to [Contribute content](../../servers/manage/community-hub-contribute.md).

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Use the community hub](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#use-the-community-hub) to download the console extension.
2. Go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Updates and servicing**, and select the **Console extensions** node.
3. Select the new extension. In the ribbon, select **Approve**.
4. Restart the console. In the upper-right corner of the console, select the bell icon to display Configuration Manager console notifications.
5. The notification says **New custom console extensions are available**.
6. To start the install, select **Install custom console extensions**.
7. When the update is complete for the extension, select **Close**. The console restarts.
8. Go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, and select the **Task Sequences** node. Right-click a task sequence, and select the new option to **Show all status messages**.

To troubleshoot the installation of an extension, see **AdminUI.ExtensionInstaller.log** in the AdminUILog directory on the computer with the console.

## Community hub support for application content

This release continues to iterate on the scenario to share apps via the [Community hub](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md). Previously you could share just the definition of the app. Another hub user could download the app's XML metadata, and create it in their site. But to actually deploy the app, they would then need to locate the app's content.

You can now download linked content for Windows Installer apps in the hub. This improvement helps you to easily get a fully functional app from the Configuration Manager community. The hub provides an integrated link to the publicly available content for the app. When you download an app with content from the hub, it downloads both the app metadata from the hub and the MSI from its shared location outside the Community hub.

After the console downloads the file, it validates the hash. This check makes sure the content didn't change during download. It then validates the digital signature on the MSI file. If it can't verify the signature, it prompts you if you still want to import the file.

To help you test this new feature, the [System Center Updates Publisher](../../../sum/tools/updates-publisher.md) is available as an app with content in the Community hub. When you download SCUP from the Community hub, the console downloads the installer content from the Microsoft Download Center.

> [!NOTE]
>
> At this time, you can't yet share an app with content in the Community hub.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Community** workspace, and select the **Community hub**.
2. Search for the app **System Center Updates Publisher**.
3. Select **Download**.
4. Specify a network path for the site to use as the content source.

After the hub downloads the app, use the following steps to verify the app:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, and select the **Applications** node.
2. Find the new application for **System Center Updates Publisher**.
3. To view the new Windows Installer deployment type, in the Details pane, switch to the **Deployment Types** tab.
4. To see the MSI downloaded from the Community hub, browse to the network path.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to install this app, make sure to review the [SCUP prerequisites and installation instructions](../../../sum/tools/install-updates-publisher.md).

## Task sequence error shows more check readiness details

Based on your feedback, the task sequence progress can now display more information about readiness checks. If a task sequence fails because the client doesn't meet the requirements configured in the **Check readiness** task sequence step, the user can now see more details about the failed prerequisites. They still see the common "task sequence error" message, but can now select an option to **Inspect**. This action shows the checks that failed on the device.

![Task sequence check readiness failure](media/8888218-task-sequence-check-readiness-failure.png)

## Disable application deployments

Based on your feedback, you can now disable application deployments.

Other objects already have similar behaviors:

- Software update deployments: Disable the deployment
- Phased deployments: Suspend the phase
- Package: Disable the program
- Task sequence: Disable the task sequence
- Configuration baseline: Disable the baseline

For device-based deployments, when you disable the deployment or object, use the client notification action to **Download Computer Policy**. This action immediately tells the client to update its policy from the site. If the deployment hasn't already started, the client receives the updated policy that the object is now disabled.

Starting in this release, you can now disable an application deployment.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Application Management**, and select the **Applications** node.
2. Select an app that you've deployed. In the details pane, switch to the **Deployment** tab.
3. Select a deployment. In the ribbon, on the **Deployment** tab, select **Disable**.

   For a user-based deployment, the user needs to sign out of Windows. Policy updates when they sign in to Windows, or every 24 hours by default.
4. For a device-based deployment, note the name of the collection in **Collection** field of the deployment.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > When you select the deployment, press **CTRL** + **C**. This keyboard shortcut copies the values of the current columns for the selected deployment.
5. Switch to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select the **Device Collections** node, and locate the target collection for the deployment. The quickest method is to search for the collection name as previously noted. You may need to select the option in the ribbon to search **All subfolders**.
6. Select the target collection for the deployment. In the ribbon, in the **Collection** group, select **Client Notification** and choose the **Download Computer Policy** action.

To enable the deployment, repeat this process but select the **Enable** action on the application deployment.

## Access the top queries shared in the Community hub from CMPivot

You can now access the top CMPivot queries shared in the Community hub from on-premises CMPivot. By leveraging pre-created CMPivot queries shared by the broader community, CMPivot users gain access to a wider variety of queries. On-premises CMPivot accesses the Community hub and returns a list of the top downloaded CMPivot queries. Users can review the top queries, customize them, and then run on-demand. This improvement gives a wider selection of queries for immediate usage without having to construct them and also allows information sharing on how to build queries for future reference.

### Prerequisites

- Enable [Community hub](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md)

  - You don't need a GitHub account to download content.
- Verify which [content categories are displayed](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_category) for Community hub
- Install the Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime extension from the [Configuration Manager console notification](../../servers/manage/community-hub.md#bkmk_webview2)
- Meet all of the [CMPivot prerequisites and permissions](../../servers/manage/cmpivot.md#prerequisites)

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > These queries are available when you run CMPivot from the Configuration Manager console. They're not yet available from standalone CMPivot.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. Go to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace then select the **Device Collections** node.
2. Select a target collection, target device, or group of devices then select **Start CMPivot** in the ribbon to launch the tool.
3. Use the Community hub icon on the menu.

   ![Community hub icon](media/7137169-hub-icon.png)
4. Review the list of top shared CMPivot queries.

   [![Top CMPivot queries from Community hub](media/7137169-cmpivot-hub-queries.png)](media/7137169-cmpivot-hub-queries.png#lightbox)
5. Select one of the top queries to load it into the query pane.
6. Edit the query if needed then select **Run Query**.
7. Optionally, add the original query or your edited version to your favorites list to run later.
8. Keep the CMPivot window open to view results from clients. When you close the CMPivot window, the session is complete. If the query has been sent, then clients still send a state message response to the server.

## Improved user experience and security with Software Center custom tabs

Since current branch version 1906, you can add up to five custom tabs to Software Center. These custom tabs let you give your users easy access to common web apps and other sites. Previously, to display websites Software Center used the Windows built-in Internet Explorer browser control.

Starting in this release, Software Center can now use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 browser control. The WebView2 browser control provides improved security and user experience. For example, more websites should work with these custom tabs without displaying script errors or security warnings.

[![Software Center with a custom tab of the Microsoft website](media/software-center-custom-tab.png)](media/software-center-custom-tab.png#lightbox)

### Prerequisites for Software Center custom tabs

The following components are required on the client device:

- [Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.2 or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/)
- [Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) via the **Evergreen standalone installer**
- In this release, the user that runs Software Center needs local **Administrator** rights.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

In this release, you currently have to manually install the Microsoft Edge WebView2 browser control on the client. If you don't install this extension, Software Center continues to use the legacy Internet Explorer control. At this time, only use the **Evergreen Standalone Installer**. To download this installer, see [Download the WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).

You can use Configuration Manager to install this runtime on clients as an application. For more information, see [Deploy applications](../../../apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications.md)

Then configure Software Center to display a custom tab. For more information, see [Software Center client settings](../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#software-center-customization---tabs).

## OneTrace support for jump lists

[Support Center OneTrace](../../support/support-center-onetrace.md) now supports jump lists for recently opened files. Jump lists let you quickly go to previously opened files, so you can work faster.

There are now three methods to open recent files in OneTrace:

- Windows taskbar jump list
- Windows Start menu recently opened list
- In OneTrace from **File** menu or **Recently opened** tab.

### Windows taskbar jump list

When the OneTrace icon is on the Windows taskbar, right-click it, and then select a file from the **Recently opened** list.

![Support Center OneTrace jump list from Windows taskbar with recently opened list](media/6991505-onetrace-jump-list.png)

### Windows Start menu recently opened list

Go to the **Start** menu, and type `onetrace`. Select a file from the **Recently opened** list.
