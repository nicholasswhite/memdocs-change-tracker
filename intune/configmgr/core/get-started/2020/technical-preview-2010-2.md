# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2010.2

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 2010.2. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

## Tenant attach: Troubleshooting portal lists a user’s devices based on usage

The troubleshooting portal in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) allows you to search for a user and view their associated devices. Starting in this release, tenant attached devices that are assigned [user device affinity automatically based on usage](../../../apps/deploy-use/link-users-and-devices-with-user-device-affinity.md#set-up-the-site-to-automatically-create-user-device-affinities) will now be returned when searching for a user.

### Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md)
- Install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client.
- Target clients with **User and Device Affinity** [client settings](../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#user-and-device-affinity) to automatically create the affinities.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### View a user's devices

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Troubleshooting + support**.
3. On the **Troubleshoot** page, select **Change user** then search for a user.
4. The **Devices** chart lists the ConfigMgr devices associated with the user.
   - Devices that previously reported affinity will resend their affinity to reflect in the admin center.
   - Devices that aren't already associated with a user will be updated once the affinity threshold has been met and reported.

## Tenant attach: Create and deploy firewall policies

You can now configure and deploy settings for [Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security) to tenant attached Windows 10 devices.

### Prerequisites

- An environment that's [tenant attached with uploaded devices](../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md)
- Windows 10 or later clients

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Make Configuration Manager collections available to assign Endpoint security policies

If you haven't already done so, make Configuration Manager collections available to assign Endpoint security policies.

1. From a Configuration Manager console connected to your top-level site, right-click on a device collection that you synchronize to Microsoft Intune admin center and select **Properties**.
2. On the **Cloud Sync** tab, enable the option to **Make this collection available to assign Endpoint security policies from Microsoft Intune admin center**.

   - You can't select this option if your Configuration Manager hierarchy isn't tenant attached.
   - The collections available for this option are limited by the [collection scope selected for tenant attach upload](../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md#bkmk_edit).

   ![Configure cloud sync](../../../../fundamentals/media/tenant-attach/cloud-sync.png)
3. Select **Add** and then select the Microsoft Entra group that you would like to synchronize with **Collect membership results**.
4. Select **OK** to save the configuration.

   Devices in this collection can now onboard with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and support use of Intune endpoint security policies.

#### Configure and assign firewall policies

1. Go to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Endpoint security** &gt; **Firewall** then **Create Policy**.
3. Create a profile with the following settings:

   - **Platform**: Windows 10 and later
     - Only Windows 10 clients can be targeted with firewall policies currently.
   - **Profile**: Microsoft Defender Firewall (ConfigMgr) (preview)
4. Select **Create** then give the profile a **Name** and a **Description**.
5. On the **Configuration settings** page, set the firewall settings for the devices.

   [![Firewall configuration settings in the Microsoft Intune admin center](../media/7768130-firewall-configuration.png)](../media/7768130-firewall-configuration.png#lightbox)
6. On the **Assignments** page, select the collections to include for the policy assignment then choose **Next**.
7. Review the settings on the **Review + Create** page and select **Create** when you're done.

#### Confirming firewall policies on the clients

You can confirm the clients applied the policies by reviewing any of the following items:

1. Review the following Configuration Manager client log files:
   - SettingsAgent.log
   - SettingsWMIHandler.log
2. View the settings in **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** by running `WF.msc` from an elevated command prompt.
3. Use the [Get-NetFirewallSetting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netsecurity/get-netfirewallsetting) PowerShell cmdlet. For example, `Get-NetFirewallSetting -All -PolicyStore ActiveStore`.
4. Review the instances of the following classes in the `ROOT\cimv2\mdm\dmmap` WMI namespace:
   - MDM_Firewall_Action04
   - MDM_Firewall_App04
   - MDM_Firewall_DomainProfile02
   - MDM_Firewall_FirewallRules02_01
   - MDM_Firewall_Global02
   - MDM_Firewall_PrivateProfile02
   - MDM_Firewall_PublicProfile02

## Enhancements to applications in Microsoft Intune admin center

We've made improvements to [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../tenant-attach/applications.md). Administrators can now do the following actions for applications in the Microsoft Intune admin center:

- **Uninstall** an application
- **Repair** installation of an application
- **Re-evaluate** the application installation status
- **Reinstall** an application has replaced **Retry installation**

[![Application installation options in the Microsoft Intune admin center](media/7979972-application-repair.png)](media/7979972-application-repair.png#lightbox)

Prerequisites for applications:

- All the prerequisites for [applications for tenant attached devices](../../../tenant-attach/applications.md)
- Install the latest version of the Configuration Manager client
- Targeted clients need to be online
- To uninstall an application:
  - The application must have at least one [deployment type](../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#start-the-create-deployment-type-wizard) with the uninstall command defined
  - Required deployments of the application can't be targeted to the client
  - The application must currently be installed on the device
- To repair an application:
  - The application must have at least one [deployment type](../../../apps/deploy-use/create-applications.md#start-the-create-deployment-type-wizard) with the repair command defined
  - The application must currently be installed on the device

Permissions needed:

- **Read** permission on **Collection**
  - Apply the permission to both targeted device collections and targeted user collections
- **Read** on the **Application**
- **Approve** on the **Application**

### Known issues with apps in Microsoft Intune admin center

In this technical preview, if you see an error notification when you install, uninstall, reevaluate, or repair an app, use the following workaround. Open SQL Server Management Studio, select the primary site database, and run the following SQL script:

```sql
DECLARE @view nvarchar(max) = OBJECT_DEFINITION(OBJECT_ID('[dbo].[vSMS_CombinedDeviceResources]'));
IF (@view IS NULL) print 'Object not found, select primary site database and re-run script'
ELSE BEGIN
       SET @view = REPLACE(REPLACE(@view, 'ck.ApprovalStatus as IsApproved', '(CASE WHEN ck.ApprovalStatus = 2 OR ck.ApprovalStatus = 3 THEN 1 ELSE ck.ApprovalStatus END) as IsApproved'), 'CREATE VIEW', 'ALTER VIEW')
       EXEC sp_executesql @view
END
```

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Uninstall, repair, or re-evaluate an application

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to **Devices** then **All Devices**.
3. Select a device that is synced from Configuration Manager via [tenant attach](../../../tenant-attach/device-sync-actions.md).
4. Choose **Applications**.
5. Select the application then the action you want to perform on the device.

## Improvements to BitLocker management

Based on your feedback, you can now manage BitLocker policies and escrow recovery keys over a cloud management gateway (CMG). This change also provides support for BitLocker management via internet-based client management (IBCM) and when you configure the site for enhanced HTTP. There's no change to the setup process for BitLocker management. For more information, see [Deploy BitLocker management](../../../protect/deploy-use/bitlocker/deploy-management-agent.md).

If you have either the Helpdesk or Self-Service portals set up, use these portals to validate that clients escrow their keys directly to a management point. For more information, see [Set up BitLocker portals](../../../protect/deploy-use/bitlocker/setup-websites.md). Continue to use BitLockerManagementHandler.log to help troubleshoot client communication.

### Known issue with BitLocker management

When the client can't communicate with an on-premises management point, there's an issue with the client's BitLocker configuration for key recovery. As a temporary work around for this preview release:

1. Set the following registry key on the client: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CCM\BLM, "UseKeyRecoveryService"=dword:00000001`
2. Restart the **SMS Agent Host** (ccmexec) service.

This value resets each time the client evaluates the BitLocker management policy, which is seven days by default.

## Improvements to deploy an OS over CMG using boot media

Technical preview branch version 2009 included support for using boot media to reimage internet-based devices that connect through a cloud management gateway (CMG).

This release streamlines the administrative workflow in the Configuration Manager console. On the **Media Management** page of the **Create Task Sequence Media Wizard**, the **Internet-based media** option no longer exists. Select the **Site-based media** option. Then still select the CMG for the management point on the **Boot Image** page.

For more information, see [Deploy an OS over CMG using boot media](technical-preview-2009.md#bkmk_osdcmg).

## Desktop Analytics support for new Windows 10 data levels

Microsoft is increasing transparency by categorizing the data that Windows 10 collects:

- **Basic** diagnostic data is recategorized as **Required** diagnostic data
- **Full** is recategorized as **Optional**
- **Enhanced (Limited)** is recategorized as **Optional (Limited)**

> [!TIP]
>
> Starting in Configuration Manager current branch version 2006, the **Diagnostic Data** tab of the Desktop Analytics service in the Configuration Manager console already uses these new labels.

If you previously configured devices for **Enhanced** or **Enhanced (Limited)**, in an upcoming release of Windows 10, they'll use the **Required** level. This change may impact the functionality of Desktop Analytics.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can test the behavioral changes now in Windows 10 Insider Preview build 19577 and later.

Configuration Manager will properly configure the devices. If you're using another mechanism to configure these policies on devices, you may need to make changes for the upcoming new behavior. For more information, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection#behaviorial-changes).

After you enroll Windows Insider devices to Desktop Analytics, it may take up to 48 hours to appear on the Desktop Analytics portal or the new configurations to take effect. Use the Configuration Manager console to look for issues or configuration alerts as you [Monitor connection health](../../../../device-updates/windows/monitor-compatibility.md).

## Immediate distribution point fallback for clients downloading software update delta content

There's a new [client setting](../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#software-updates) for software updates. If delta content is unavailable from distribution points in the current boundary group, you can allow immediate fallback to a neighbor or the site default boundary group distribution points. This setting is useful when using delta content for software updates since the timeout setting per download job is 5 minutes.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Observe the new fallback behavior for delta content

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to **Administration** &gt; **Overview** &gt; **Client Settings**.
2. Open either the default set of client settings or a custom set of settings.
3. Select the **Software Updates** group of client settings.
4. The **If content is unavailable from distribution points in the current boundary group, immediately fallback to a neighbor or the site default** setting has the following options:

   - **Yes**: Allows fallback for delta content to occur immediately
   - **No**: Doesn't allow fallback immediately (default)
5. For the following settings, observe the software update download behaviors for missing content:

   - **Yes**: For delta content, the client doesn't wait to reach the fallback time (in minutes) defined by the [Boundary Group relationship](../../servers/deploy/configure/boundary-group-procedures.md#configure-fallback-behavior). Clients immediately fall back to a neighbor or the site default content distribution points when both of the following conditions are met:

     - Delta content is unavailable from distribution points in the current boundary group.
     - The software update deployment allows fallback.
   - **No** (default): The client honors the fallback time (in minutes) defined by the [Boundary Group relationship](../../servers/deploy/configure/boundary-group-procedures.md#configure-fallback-behavior) when it's allowed on the software update deployment. Delta download content may fail with a timeout even if the update content is available on a neighbor or the site default distribution point group.

## Disable Microsoft Entra authentication for onboarded tenants

You can now disable Microsoft Entra authentication for tenants not associated with users and devices. When you onboard Configuration Manager to Microsoft Entra ID, it allows the site and clients to use modern authentication. Currently, Microsoft Entra device authentication is enabled for all onboarded tenants, whether or not it has devices. For example, you have a separate tenant with a subscription that you use for compute resources to support a cloud management gateway. If there aren't users or devices associated with the tenant, disable Microsoft Entra authentication.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](technical-preview-2003.md#bkmk_feedback) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace.
2. Expand **Cloud Services** and select the **Azure Services** node.
3. Select the target connection of type **Cloud Management**. In the ribbon, select **Properties**.
4. Switch to the **Applications** tab.
5. Select the option to **Disable Microsoft Entra authentication for this tenant**.
6. Select **OK** to save and close the connection properties.

## Additional options when creating app registrations in Microsoft Entra ID

You can now specify **Never** for the expiration of a secret key when creating Microsoft Entra app registrations. For more information about creating app registrations, see [Configure Azure Services](../../servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md#azure-app-properties).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Choosing **Never** as an option for secret key expiry carries security risk since a secret that's compromised and never expires can become a point of entry into your environment.

## Validate internet access for the service connection point

If you use Desktop Analytics or tenant attach, the service connection point now checks important internet endpoints. These checks help make sure that the cloud-connected services are available. It also helps you troubleshoot issues by quickly determining if network connectivity is a problem.

For more details, review the **EndpointConnectivityCheckWorker.log** file on the service connection point.

A failure isn't always determined by the HTTP status code, but if there's network connectivity to an endpoint. The following scenarios can cause a check to fail:

- Network connection timeout
- SSL/TLS failure
- Unexpected status code:

  | Status code | Description | Possible reason |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 407 | Proxy authentication required | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 408 | Request timeout | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 426 | Upgrade required | May indicate a TLS misconfiguration |
  | 451 | Unavailable for legal reasons | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 502 | Bad gateway | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 511 | Network authentication required | May indicate a proxy issue |
  | 598 | Network read timeout error | Not RFC compliant, but used by some proxy servers to indicate a network timeout |
  | 599 | Network connection timeout error | Not RFC compliant, but used by some proxy servers to indicate a network timeout |

There are also the following status messages for the **SMS_SERVICE_CONNECTOR** component:

| Message ID | Severity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11410 | Informational | All checks are successful |
| 11411 | Warning | One or more non-critical failures occurred |
| 11412 | Error | One or more critical failures occurred |

For more information on required internet endpoints, see [Internet access requirements](../../plan-design/network/internet-endpoints.md).

## Improvements to the administration service

The Configuration Manager REST API, the administration service, requires a secure HTTPS connection. With the previous methods to enable HTTPS, enabling IIS on the SMS Provider was a prerequisite.

Starting in this release, you no longer need to enable IIS on the SMS Provider for the administration service. When you enable the site for enhanced HTTP, it creates a self-signed certificate for the SMS Provider, and automatically binds it without requiring IIS.

If you previously had IIS installed on the SMS Provider, you can remove it. Then restart the SMS_REST_PROVIDER component.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you don't use enhanced HTTP, you need to manually bind a server authentication certificate to port 443 on the SMS Provider. One method is to use IIS.
>
> You can also use the netsh command line tool, which doesn't require IIS. You can use a command line similar to the following example:
>
> `netsh http add sslcert ippport=<ipaddress>:443 certhash=<certhash>`
>
> You may require additional command line options depending upon your environment and requirements. For more information, see [Netsh http commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-http).

For more information on the Configuration Manager REST API, see [What is the administration service?](../../../develop/adminservice/overview.md)
