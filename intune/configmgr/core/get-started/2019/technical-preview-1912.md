# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 1912

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 1912. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

## Bootstrap a task sequence immediately after client registration

When you install and register a new Configuration Manager client, and also deploy a task sequence to it, it's difficult to determine how soon after registration it will run the task sequence. This release introduces a new client setup property that you can use to start a task sequence on a client after it successfully registers with the site.

For example, you provision a new Windows 10 device with Windows Autopilot, auto-enroll it to Microsoft Intune, and then install the Configuration Manager client for co-management. If you specify this new option, the newly provisioned client then runs a task sequence. This process gives you additional flexibility to install applications and software updates, or configure settings.

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

1. [Create a non-OS deployment task sequence](../../../osd/deploy-use/create-a-task-sequence-for-non-operating-system-deployments.md)) to install apps, install software updates, and configure settings.
2. [Deploy this task sequence](../../../osd/deploy-use/deploy-a-task-sequence.md) to the new built-in collection, **All Provisioning Devices**. Note the task sequence deployment ID, for example `PRI20001`.
3. [Install the Configuration Manager client](../../clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers.md#BKMK_Manual) on a device, and include the following property: `PROVISIONTS=PRI20001`. Set the value of this property as the task sequence deployment ID.

   - If you're installing the client from Intune during co-management enrollment, see [How to prepare internet-based devices for co-management](../../../comanage/how-to-prepare-Win10.md).

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > This method may have additional prerequisites. For example, enrolling the site to Microsoft Entra ID, or creating a content-enabled cloud management gateway.

After the client installs and properly registers with the site, it starts the referenced task sequence. If client registration fails, the task sequence won't start.

## New management insight rules from Microsoft Services

This release includes additional [management insight](../../servers/manage/management-insights.md) rules courtesy of Microsoft Premier Field Engineering. These rules are a sample of the many more checks that Microsoft Premier provides in the [Services Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/health/getting-started-with-on-demand-assessments).

- **Reduce the number of applications and packages on distribution points**: Microsoft officially supports a combined total of up to 10,000 packages and applications on a distribution point. Exceeding this total can lead to operational problems. For more information, see [Size and scale numbers - distribution point](../../plan-design/configs/size-and-scale-numbers.md#distribution-point).
- **Update all sites to the same version**: Use the same version of Configuration Manager in a hierarchy. This configuration makes sure all sites provide the same functionality. Sites of different versions in the same hierarchy introduce interoperability scenarios. Later versions of Configuration Manager include new features and resolve known issues. For more information, see [Interoperability between different versions](../../plan-design/hierarchy/interoperability-between-different-versions.md).
- **Heartbeat Discovery is disabled**: Heartbeat discovery requires that you install the Configuration Manager client on devices. It's the only discovery method that clients start. All other methods occur on site servers. Heartbeat discovery is essential to keep client activity status current. It makes sure that the site doesn't accidentally age out the resource records from the site database. For more information, see [Heartbeat discovery](../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutHeartbeat).
- **Long running collection queries enabled for incremental updates**: Collections with a last incremental refresh time higher than 30 seconds use site server and database resources, which could potentially impact overall Configuration Manager performance. For more information, see [Best practices for collections](../../clients/manage/collections/best-practices-for-collections.md).
- **Secondary site installation issues**: The installation status of some secondary sites is **Pending** or **Failed**. These states mean that you started the install but it didn't complete successfully. Until the secondary site install finishes, clients may not communicate properly with the primary site. Check the **Monitoring** workspace, and retry the installation. For more information, see [Retry installation of a failed update](../../servers/manage/post-in-console-updates.md#retry-installation-of-a-failed-update).
- **Active Directory System Discovery is configured to run too frequently**: You typically don't need to configure Active Directory System Discovery to occur more frequently than every three hours. A more frequent configuration can have a negative performance impact on Active Directory, the network, and Configuration Manager. Enable incremental synchronization instead of using a full sync schedule. For more information, see [Active Directory system discovery](../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutSystem).
- **Active Directory Security Group Discovery is configured to run too frequently**: You typically don't need to configure Active Directory Security Group Discovery to occur more frequently than every three hours. A more frequent configuration can have a negative performance impact on Active Directory, the network, and Configuration Manager. Enable incremental synchronization instead of using a full sync schedule. For more information, see [Active Directory group discovery](../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutGroup).
- **Active Directory User Discovery is configured to run too frequently**: You typically don't need to configure Active Directory User Discovery to occur more frequently than every three hours. A more frequent configuration can have a negative performance impact on Active Directory, the network, and Configuration Manager. Enable incremental synchronization instead of using a full sync schedule. For more information, see [Active Directory user discovery](../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser).
- **Collections limited to All Systems or All Users**: Review any collections that use the **All Systems** or **All Users** collections as the limiting collection. Configuration Manager updates the membership of these default collections with data from the Active Directory discovery methods. This data may not be valid information for Configuration Manager clients.

For more information on these rules, see [Remediation steps for Configuration Manager management insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/health/remediation-steps-configmgr).

## Client Log Collection

You can now trigger a client device to upload its client logs to the site server by sending a client notification action from the Configuration Manager console.

### Permissions for client log collection

To collect client logs, your administrative user needs:

- **Notify resource** permission on the **Collection**
  - The Full Administrator and Operations Administrator built-in roles have this permission by default.

### Log files

- Diagnostics.log

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send [Feedback](../../understand/product-feedback.md) with your thoughts on the feature.

#### Collect client logs

1. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, go to either the **Devices** or **Device Collections** node.
2. Right-click on a device, or a device collection.
3. Select **Client Diagnostics**, then select **Collect Client Logs**.

   ![Collect client logs from the console](media/4226618-collect-client-logs.png)

A client notification message is sent to the selected clients to gather the CCM logs. The logs are returned using software inventory file collection. You can also select **Collect Client Logs** under **Client Diagnostics** from either the **Device Collections** or **Devices** node using the ribbon.

#### View client logs

1. From the **Devices** node, right-click on the device you want to view logs for.
2. Select **Start**, then **Resource Explorer**.
3. From **Resource Explorer**, click on **Diagnostic Files**.
4. In the **Diagnostic Files** list, you can see the collection date for the files. The name format of the client logs is `Support_<guid>.zip`.
5. Right-click on the zip file and select one of the following options:
   - **Open Support Center**: Launches [Support Center](../../support/support-center.md).
   - **Copy**: Copies the row information from Resource Explorer.
   - **View file**: Opens the folder where the zip file is located with File Explorer.
   - **Save**: Opens a Save File dialog for the selected file.
   - **Export**: Saves the Resource Explorer columns shown in **Diagnostic Files**.
   - **Refresh**: Refreshes the file list.
   - **Properties**: Returns the properties on the selected file.

## Improvements to OS deployment

This release includes the following improvements to OS deployment:

- Based on your feedback, the task sequence environment includes a new read-only variable, `_TSSecureBoot`. Use this variable to determine the state of secure boot on a UEFI-enabled device. The variable can have one of the following values:

  - `NA`: The associated registry value doesn't exist, which means the device doesn't support secure boot.
  - `Enabled`: The device has secure boot enabled.
  - `Disabled`: The device has secure boot disabled.
- You can now set task sequence variables to configure the user context that the [Run Command Line](../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_RunCommandLine) and [Run PowerShell Script](../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_RunPowerShellScript) steps use. For example, now you don't need to configure the **Run Command Line** step with a placeholder account to use the [SMSTSRunCommandLineUserName](../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-variables.md#SMSTSRunCommandLineUserName) and [SMSTSRunCommandLineUserPassword](../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-variables.md#SMSTSRunCommandLineUserPassword) variables.

  Configure `SMSTSRunCommandLineAsUser` with one of the following values:

  - `true`: Any further **Run Command Line** steps run in the context of the user specified in `SMSTSRunCommandLineUserName`.
  - `false`: Any further **Run Command Line** steps run in the context that you configured on the step.

  Configure `SMSTSRunPowerShellAsUser` with the same values to apply to **Run PowerShell Script** steps.
- Based on your feedback, you can now set the [Run PowerShell Script](../../../osd/understand/task-sequence-steps.md#BKMK_RunPowerShellScript) **Parameters** property to a variable. For example, if you specify `%MyScriptVariable%`, when the task sequence runs the script, it adds the value of this custom variable to the PowerShell command line.
