# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2302

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 2302. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

## Dark theme extended to delete secondary site wizard

The Configuration Manager console now extends the dark theme for the delete secondary site wizard. This wizard will also have a new look for the normal theme. This is part of the ongoing effort to make dark theme and overall admin console experience better.

To use the theme, select the arrow from the top left of the ribbon, then choose **Switch console theme**. Select **Switch console theme** again to return to the light theme.

### Known issue

Console restart is required on doing the theme switch, as the node navigation pane might not properly render when you move to a new workspace.

## Enable Windows features introduced via Windows servicing that are off by default

To learn more about the settings: “Enable Windows features introduced via Windows servicing that are off by default”, please read this [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/commercial-control-for-continuous-innovation/ba-p/3737575). The post describes the Commercial control for continuous innovation in Windows. The setting for this policy is now integrated with the Configuration Manager 2302 Technical Preview. More information on the Commercial control timeline and versions of Windows 11 supported by the setting can be found in the blog.

The Windows features that the policy will control will be released in later part of 2023. This ConfigMgr Technical Preview feature is for awareness and not for testing in February 2023.
