# Features in Configuration Manager technical preview version 2205

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (technical preview branch)*

This article introduces the features that are available in the technical preview for Configuration Manager, version 2205. Install this version to update and add new features to your technical preview site.

Review the [technical preview](../technical-preview.md) article before installing this update. That article familiarizes you with the general requirements and limitations for using a technical preview, how to update between versions, and how to provide feedback.

The following sections describe the new features to try out in this version:

## Offset for reoccuring monthly maintenance window schedules

Based upon your feedback, you can now offset monthly maintenance window schedules to better align deployments with the release of monthly security updates. For example, using an offset of two days after the second Tuesday of the month, sets the maintenance window for Thursday.

[![Screenshot of menu displaying options for the new custom schedule for setting offset days.](media/3601127-window-schedule.png)](media/3601127-window-schedule.png#lightbox)

### Try it out!

Try to complete the tasks. Then send **Feedback** from the **Home** tab of the ribbon letting us know how it worked.

**Create a custom schedule that sets maintenance window offset from a base day**

1. In the **Device Collection** workspace, create **New Collection**, and select **Properties**.
2. Select on **Maintenance Window** and choose **New Custom Schedule**.
3. For the custom schedule, select **Monthly** and put in a base day such as the second Tuesday.
4. Verify the **Offset (days)** and the number of days for the offset then **OK** when finished.
5. Complete the deployment as usual.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Before using this feature, upgrade the hierarchy to version 2205.

## Improvements to cloud management gateway (CMG) workflow

You can now approve the application workflow through email. For the application approvals through email, manually add the CMG URL in the Microsoft Entra app as single page application redirect URI. For more information on how to change the URI, see [Create an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID for your App Service app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad).

## Script execution timeout for compliance settings

You can now define a **Script Execution Timeout (seconds)** when configuring [client settings](../../clients/deploy/about-client-settings.md#compliance-settings) for compliance settings. The timeout value can be set from a minimum of 60 seconds to a maximum of 600 seconds. This new setting allows you more flexibility for configuration items when you need to run scripts that may exceed the default of 60 seconds.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016

Configuration Manager will now utilize the [Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 unified](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints?#new-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016-functionality-in-the-modern-unified-solution) solution for anti-virus and endpoint detection and response. From this technical preview, devices that are targeted with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding policy use the unified agent versus the previous Microsoft Monitoring Agent based solution (where applicable).

> [!NOTE]
>
> This functionality will only apply to clients that are onboarding. Upgrade scenarios will be supported in a future release. If you'd like to test this new functionality, you can offboard and onboard an existing device.
