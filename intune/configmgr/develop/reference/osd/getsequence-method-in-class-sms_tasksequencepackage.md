# GetSequence Method in Class SMS_TaskSequencePackage

The `GetSequence` Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) class method, in Configuration Manager, gets a task sequence ([SMS_TaskSequence Server WMI Class](sms_tasksequence-server-wmi-class.md)) from a task sequence package ([SMS_TaskSequencePackage Server WMI Class](sms_tasksequencepackage-server-wmi-class.md)).

The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code, and it defines the method.

## Syntax

```
SInt32 GetSequence(
      SMS_TaskSequencePackage TaskSequencePackage,
      SMS_TaskSequence TaskSequence
);
```

#### Parameters

`TaskSequencePackage` Data type: `SMS_TaskSequencePackage`

Qualifiers: [in]

The task sequence package that contains the requested task sequence. See [SMS_TaskSequencePackage Server WMI Class](sms_tasksequencepackage-server-wmi-class.md).

`TaskSequence` Data type: `SMS_TaskSequence`

Qualifiers: [out]

The [SMS_TaskSequence Server WMI Class](sms_tasksequence-server-wmi-class.md) object that represents the task sequence contained in the task sequence package specified in `TaskSequencePackage`.

## Return Values

An `SInt32` data type that is 0 to indicate success or non-zero to indicate failure.

For information about handling returned errors, see [About Configuration Manager Errors](../../core/understand/about-configuration-manager-errors.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> The task sequence is returned in the `TaskSequence` parameter.

## Remarks

You use `GetSequence` to get a [SMS_TaskSequence Server WMI Class](sms_tasksequence-server-wmi-class.md) WMI object that represents a task sequence from a task sequence package. With this object, you can make changes to the task sequence and then update the task sequence package by using the [SetSequence Method in Class SMS_TaskSequencePackage](setsequence-method-in-class-sms_tasksequencepackage.md).
