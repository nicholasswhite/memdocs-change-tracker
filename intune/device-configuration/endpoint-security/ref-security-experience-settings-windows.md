# Settings for the Windows Security experience profile in Microsoft Intune

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> On October 14, 2025, [Windows 10 reached end of support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/windows-10-end-of-support) and won't receive quality and feature updates. Windows 10 is an **allowed** version in Intune. Devices running this version can still enroll in Intune and use eligible features, but functionality won't be guaranteed and can vary.
