# Use custom settings for Windows Holographic for Business devices in Intune

Using Microsoft Intune, you can add or create custom settings for your Windows Holographic for Business devices using **custom profiles**. Custom profiles are a feature in Intune. They're designed to add device settings and features that aren't built in to Intune.

This article applies to:

- Windows Holographic for Business
- Windows

Windows Holographic for Business custom profiles use Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) settings to configure different features. These settings are typically used by mobile device manufacturers to control features on the device.

Windows Holographic for Business makes many configuration service providers (CSPs) settings available. For a CSP overview, go to [Introduction to configuration service providers (CSPs) for IT pros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers). For specific CSPs supported by Windows Holographic, go to [CSPs supported in Windows Holographic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference#hololens).

If you're looking for a specific setting, remember that the [Windows Holographic for Business device restriction profile](ref-device-restrictions-windows-holographic.md) includes many built-in settings. So, you might not need to enter custom values.

This article shows you how to create a custom profile for Windows Holographic for Business devices. It also includes a list of the recommended OMA-URI settings.

## Before you begin

- [Create a Windows custom profile](configure-custom-settings.md#create-the-profile).

## Custom OMA-URI Settings

**Add**: Enter the following settings:

- **Name**: Enter a unique name for the OMA-URI setting so you can identify the setting in the settings list.
- **Description**: Enter a description that gives an overview of the setting, and any other important details.
- **OMA-URI** (case sensitive): Enter the OMA-URI you want to use as a setting.
- **Data type**: Select the data type you want for this OMA-URI setting. Your options:

  - String
  - String (XML file)
  - Date and time
  - Integer
  - Floating point
  - Boolean
  - Base64 (file)
- **Value**: Enter the data value you want to associate with the OMA-URI you entered. The value depends on the data type you selected. For example, if you select **Date and time**, select the value from a date picker.

After you add and **Save** your settings, you can select **Export**. **Export** creates a list of all the values you added in a comma-separated values (`.csv`) file.

## Find the policies you can configure

There's a complete list of all configuration service providers (CSPs) that Windows Holographic supports at [CSPs supported in Windows Holographic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference#hololens). Not all settings are compatible with all Windows Holographic versions. The table in [CSPs supported in Windows Holographic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference#hololens) lists the supported versions for each CSP.

Also, Intune doesn't support all of the settings listed in [CSPs supported in Windows Holographic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference#hololens). To find out if Intune supports the setting you want, open the article for that setting. Each setting page shows its supported operation. To work with Intune, the setting must support the **Add** or **Replace** operations.
