# Use the Take a Test app on Windows devices in Microsoft Intune

Education profiles in Intune are designed for students to take a test or exam on devices. This feature includes the **Take a Test** app.

The Take a Test app lets you securely administer online tests on your classroom's Windows devices. To set up the Take a Test app, you create a device configuration profile in Intune and configure the secure assessment settings.

After you configure the profile, assign and deploy it to your students.

When the student signs in, the Take a Test app automatically opens with the test you entered. No other apps can run on the device while the test is in progress. [Take tests in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/education/windows/take-tests-in-windows) provides more details on the Take a Test app.

This article lists the steps to create a device configuration profile in Microsoft Intune. It also lists and describes the available settings for your Windows devices.

> - Windows

![](../../media/icons/16/rbac.svg) **Roles requirements**

>
> - Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with an account that has the **[Policy and Profile Manager](../../fundamentals/role-based-access-control/ref-built-in-roles.md#policy-and-profile-manager)** built-in role. For more information on the built-in roles, go to [Role-based access control for Microsoft Intune](../../fundamentals/role-based-access-control/overview.md).

## Create a device profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** &gt; **Manage devices** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Create** &gt; **New policy**.
3. Enter the following properties:

   - **Platform**: Select **Windows 10 and later**.
   - **Profile type**: Select **Templates** &gt; **Secure assessment (Education)**.
4. Select **Create**.
5. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the new profile.
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended.
6. Select **Next**.
7. In **Configuration settings**, enter the settings you want to configure:

   - **Account type**: Choose how users sign in to the test. Your options:
     - Azure AD account (Microsoft Entra account)
     - Domain account
     - Local account
     - Local guest account
   - **Account user name**: Enter the user name of the account used with the Take a Test app. You can enter accounts in the following format:
     - `user@contoso.com`
     - `domain\username`
     - `user@contoso.com`
     - `computerName\username`
   - **Account name**: To set up a local guest account type, enter the name of the account used with the Take a Test app. The account name will appear as a tile on the sign-in screen. Students click the tile to launch the test.​
   - **Assessment URL**: Enter the URL of the test you want users to take. For more information on getting the URL, see the [Take a Test documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/education/windows/take-tests-in-windows).
   - **Printer connection**: **Require** only allows access to the Take a Test app from devices that are connected to a printer. This setting also makes the app's print button available to test-takers. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may allow students to access the app from devices that aren't connected to a printer.​
   - **Screen monitoring**: **Allow** monitors the screen activity while users are taking a test. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may prevent you from monitoring the screen during the test.
   - **Text suggestions**: Choose **Allow** so test takers can see text suggestions. When set to **Not configured** (default), Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may block text suggestions while users are taking a test.
8. Select **Next**.
9. In **Scope tags** (optional), assign a tag to filter the profile to specific IT groups, such as `US-NC IT Team` or `JohnGlenn_ITDepartment`. For more information about scope tags, see [Use RBAC and scope tags for distributed IT](../../fundamentals/role-based-access-control/scope-tags.md).

   Select **Next**.
10. In **Assignments**, select the users or user group that will receive your profile. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](../assign-device-profile.md).

    Select **Next**.
11. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the profile is assigned. The policy is also shown in the profiles list.

The next time each device checks in, the policy is applied.
