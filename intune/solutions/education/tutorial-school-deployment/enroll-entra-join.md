# Automatic Intune enrollment via Microsoft Entra join

If you're setting up a Windows device individually, you can use the out-of-box experience to join it to your school's Microsoft Entra tenant, and automatically enroll it in Intune. With this process, no advance preparation is needed:

1. Follow the on-screen prompts for region selection, keyboard selection, and network connection.
2. Wait for updates. If any updates are available, they are installed at this time.  ![Windows 11 OOBE - updates page](media/enroll-entra-join/win11-oobe-updates.png)
3. When prompted, select **Set up for work or school** and authenticate using your school's Microsoft Entra account.  ![Windows 11 OOBE - authentication page](media/enroll-entra-join/win11-oobe-auth.png)
4. The device joins Microsoft Entra ID and automatically enroll in Intune. All settings defined in Intune are applied to the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you configured enrollment restrictions in Intune blocking personal Windows devices, this process will not complete. You will need to use a different enrollment method, or ensure that the devices are registered in Windows Autopilot.
