# iPads with no user affinity

iPads used in earlier grades are commonly enrolled with no user affinity to simplify the user experience for younger students and to allow sharing of devices. For more information, please refer to [Enroll devices with Automated Device Enrollment](enroll-ios-ade.md).

These iPads generally have additional restrictions that are not suitable for 1:1 devices.

To learn more, see:

- [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](../../../device-configuration/settings-catalog/index.md)
- [Restrictions payload](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/restrictions)

> [!TIP]
>
> When creating a settings catalog profile in the Microsoft Intune admin center, you can copy a policy name from this article and paste it into the settings picker search field to find the desired policy.

Use Graph to create the settings catalog policy in your tenant without assignments or scope tags.

This will create a policy in your tenant with the name **_MSLearn_Example_CommonEDU - iPads - No user affinity**.

```msgraph
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/configurationPolicies
Content-Type: application/json

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If it's the first time using Graph Explorer, you may need to authorize the application to access your tenant or to modify the existing permissions. This graph call requires *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permissions. You can grant the required permissions by selecting **modify permissions** and then selecting **Consent**.
4. The policy is created in your tenant and can be edited to meet your requirements before assigning to groups.

> [!NOTE]
>
> As of July 31 2025, Microsoft Graph replaced use of the *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permission with *DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All* for the following API calls:

> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceShellScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceHealthScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceComplianceScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceCustomAttributeShellScripts
