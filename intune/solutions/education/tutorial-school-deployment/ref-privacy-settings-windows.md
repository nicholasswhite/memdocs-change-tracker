# Windows privacy

Microsoft Intune and Intune for Education can configure privacy settings for Windows. This article summarizes the configurations that are most commonly used for student and teacher devices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The settings in this article configure user privacy. These settings should only be deployed after careful consideration.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is an optional policy.

To learn more, see [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS devices](../../../device-configuration/settings-catalog/index.md)

> [!TIP]
>
> When creating a settings catalog profile in the Microsoft Intune admin center, you can copy a policy name from this article and paste it into the settings picker search field to find the desired policy.

| **Category** | **Name** | **Value** | **Notes** | **CSP** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy | **Let Apps Access Location** | Force allow. | Windows apps are allowed to access location. You can specify either a default setting for all apps or a per-app setting by specifying a Package Family Name. You can get the Package Family Name for an app by using the Get-AppPackage Windows PowerShell cmdlet. A per-app setting overrides the default setting. | [Privacy/LetAppsAccessLocation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-privacy#letappsaccesslocation) |
| System | **Allow Location** | Force Location On. All Location Privacy settings are toggled on and grayed out. Users can't change the settings and all consent permissions will be automatically suppressed. | Required to invoke **Locate device** action on Windows devices in Intune. | [System/AllowLocation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-system#allowlocation) |

Use Graph to create the settings catalog policy in your tenant without assignments or scope tags.

This will create a policy in your tenant with the name **_MSLearn_Example_CommonEDU - Windows - Privacy**.

```msgraph
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/configurationPolicies
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"_MSLearn_Example_CommonEDU - Windows - Privacy","description":"https://aka.ms/ManageEduDevices","platforms":"windows10","technologies":"mdm","roleScopeTagIds":["0"],"settings":[{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSetting","settingInstance":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"device_vendor_msft_policy_config_privacy_letappsaccesslocation","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"device_vendor_msft_policy_config_privacy_letappsaccesslocation_1","children":[]}}},{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSetting","settingInstance":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"device_vendor_msft_policy_config_system_allowlocation","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"device_vendor_msft_policy_config_system_allowlocation_2","children":[]}}}]}
```

1. Click *Try it* to open Graph Explorer.
2. Once Graph Explorer is open, select the ![](../../../media/icons/16/person.svg) user icon in the top right to sign-in and sign in with your Intune administrator organizational account.
3. Click **Run query** to create the policy in your tenant.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If it's the first time using Graph Explorer, you may need to authorize the application to access your tenant or to modify the existing permissions. This graph call requires *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permissions. You can grant the required permissions by selecting **modify permissions** and then selecting **Consent**.
4. The policy is created in your tenant and can be edited to meet your requirements before assigning to groups.

> [!NOTE]
>
> As of July 31 2025, Microsoft Graph replaced use of the *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permission with *DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All* for the following API calls:
>
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceShellScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceHealthScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceComplianceScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceCustomAttributeShellScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceManagementScripts
