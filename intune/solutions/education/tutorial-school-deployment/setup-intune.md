# Set up Microsoft Intune

Without the proper tools and resources, managing hundreds or thousands of devices in a school environment can be a complex and time-consuming task. Microsoft Intune is a collection of services that simplifies the management of devices at scale.

The Microsoft Intune service can be managed in different ways.

- **Intune admin center** is the primary Intune interface that supports the entire device lifecycle, from the enrollment phase through retirement. IT administrators can manage all settings across all Intune supported platforms.
- **Intune for Education** is a curated view of Intune that supports the entire device lifecycle, from the enrollment phase through retirement. IT administrators can start managing classroom devices with bulk enrollment options and a streamlined deployment. At the end of the school year, IT admins can reset devices, ensuring they're ready for the next year.

  For more information, see [Intune for Education documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-education/what-is-intune-for-education).

> [!TIP]
>
> **Intune** and **Intune for Education** both configure the **Intune** service. Changes made in one admin center are reflected in the other. However, **Intune for Education** only supports a subset of policies and apps curated to suit simple K-12 scenarios on Windows and iPadOS.

### Disable Windows Hello for Business

![](../../../media/icons/16/check.svg) Disable functionality typically inaccessible to students

Windows Hello for Business is a biometric authentication feature that allows users to sign in to their devices using a PIN, password, or fingerprint. Windows Hello for Business is enabled by default on Windows devices, and to set it up, users must perform for multifactor authentication (MFA). As a result, this feature might not be ideal for students, who don't have MFA enabled.

> [!TIP]
>
> **Passwordless for Students**
>
> If you're interested in using Windows Hello for Business with students, then review our guidance on how you can use Temporary Access Pass. For more information, see [Passwordless for Students](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/deploy/protect-passwordless-students).

It's common for Windows Hello for Business to be disabled at the tenant level. Then, a policy can be targeted at users or devices that need it. For example, staff and teachers.

To disable Windows Hello for Business at the tenant level:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** &gt; **By platform** &gt; **Windows** &gt; **Device onboarding** &gt; **Enrollment**.
3. Select **Windows Hello for Business**.
4. Ensure that **Configure Windows Hello for Business** is set to **disabled**.
5. Select **Save**.
