# Manage devices with Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune offers a streamlined remote device management experience throughout the school year. IT administrators can optimize device settings, deploy new applications, updates, ensuring that security and privacy are maintained.

With Intune, there are several ways to manage students' devices. Groups can be created to organize devices and students, to facilitate remote management. You can determine which applications students have access to, and fine tune device settings and restrictions. You can also monitor which devices students sign in to, and troubleshoot devices remotely.

## Remote actions

Intune allows you to perform actions on devices without having to sign in to the devices. For example, you can send a command to a device to restart or to turn off, or you can locate a device.
