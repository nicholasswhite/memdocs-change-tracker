Use Graph to create the settings catalog policy in your tenant without assignments or scope tags.

This will create a policy in your tenant with the name **_MSLearn_Example_CommonEDU - iPads - Apple Intelligence**.

```msgraph
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/configurationPolicies
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"_MSLearn_Example_CommonEDU - iPads - Apple Intelligence","description":"","platforms":"iOS","technologies":"mdm,appleRemoteManagement","roleScopeTagIds":["0"],"settings":[{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSetting","settingInstance":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationGroupSettingCollectionInstance","settingDefinitionId":"com.apple.applicationaccess_com.apple.applicationaccess","groupSettingCollectionValue":[{"children":[{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowgenmoji","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowgenmoji_false","children":[]}},{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowimageplayground","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowimageplayground_false","children":[]}},{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowimagewand","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowimagewand_false","children":[]}},{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowpersonalizedhandwritingresults","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowpersonalizedhandwritingresults_false","children":[]}},{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance","settingDefinitionId":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowwritingtools","choiceSettingValue":{"@odata.type":"#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue","value":"com.apple.applicationaccess_allowwritingtools_false","children":[]}}]}]}}]}
```

1. Click *Try it* to open Graph Explorer.
2. Once Graph Explorer is open, select the ![](../../../media/icons/16/person.svg) user icon in the top right to sign-in and sign in with your Intune administrator organizational account.
3. Click **Run query** to create the policy in your tenant.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If it's the first time using Graph Explorer, you may need to authorize the application to access your tenant or to modify the existing permissions. This graph call requires *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permissions. You can grant the required permissions by selecting **modify permissions** and then selecting **Consent**.
4. The policy is created in your tenant and can be edited to meet your requirements before assigning to groups.

> [!NOTE]
>
> As of July 31 2025, Microsoft Graph replaced use of the *DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All* permission with *DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All* for the following API calls:
>
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceShellScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceHealthScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceComplianceScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceCustomAttributeShellScripts
> - ~/deviceManagement/deviceManagementScripts
