# Security Copilot agents in Intune overview

Security Copilot agents in Intune are AI-powered assistants that enhance enterprise security. They automate tasks for endpoint protection, identity management, threat intelligence, and device configuration. They help IT teams quickly address vulnerabilities, policy gaps, and emerging threats.

Agents are built on Microsoft Security Copilot's generative AI and automation capabilities. They observe, reason, and act with oversight and review from your administrators. Each agent is tailored to a specific use case, operates within the Intune admin center, and uses role-based access controls.

## Available agents

Microsoft Intune includes specialized Security Copilot agents, each designed for a specific security scenario. The following agents are available:

#### Change Review Agent

#### Device Offboarding Agent

#### Policy Configuration Agent

> With the *Policy Configuration Agent*, you import documents or write instructions in plain language. The agent uses this information to find matching settings in the Intune settings catalog and recommends values for these settings. You can then use the agent to create a policy with those settings and their values.
