# Supported operating systems and browsers in Intune

Before setting up Microsoft Intune, review the supported operating systems and browsers.

For more information on configuration service provider support, visit the [Configuration service provider reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference).

## Intune supported operating systems

- Ubuntu LTS, version 24.04 and 26.04
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 9
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 10

> [!NOTE]
>
> Ubuntu Desktop already has a GNOME graphical desktop environment installed.

### Microsoft

- Windows 11 Home, S, Pro, Pro Education, Education, Enterprise, and IoT Enterprise editions
- Windows 10/11 Cloud PCs on Windows 365

  You can continue to use Microsoft Intune to manage devices running Windows 11 the same as with Windows 10. If another article doesn't explicitly reference Windows 11, assume that feature support for Windows 10 also includes Windows 11.

  Some features might not be available on Windows 11. This article lists some [known issues](#windows-11-known-issues). As always, test your policies before broadly deploying them across your devices.
- Windows 10 LTSC 2019/2021 and Windows 11 LTSC 2024 (Enterprise and IoT Enterprise editions)
- Windows Holographic for Business

  For more information about managing devices running Windows Holographic for Business, see [Windows Holographic for Business support](../solutions/windows-holographic.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Not all Windows editions support all available operating system features being configured through MDM. For more information, see the [Windows configuration service provider reference docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/how-it-pros-can-use-configuration-service-providers). Each CSP highlights which Windows editions are supported.

Customers with Enterprise Management + Security (EMS) can also use [Microsoft Entra ID to register Windows devices](../device-enrollment/windows/enable-automatic-mdm.md).

For guidelines on using Windows virtual machines with Intune, see [Using Windows virtual machines](../solutions/windows-virtual-machines.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - On October 14, 2025, [Windows 10 reached end of support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/windows-10-end-of-support) and won't receive quality and feature updates. Windows 10 is an **allowed** version in Intune. Devices running this version can still enroll in Intune and use eligible features, but functionality won't be guaranteed and can vary.
> - Intune doesn't currently support managing UWF enabled devices. For more information, see [Unified Write Filter (UWF) feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/unified-write-filter).

### Windows 11 known issues

- Currently, you can use Intune to configure a single-app kiosk on Windows 11 devices. For more information about Windows 11 multi-app kiosk support, go to [Set up a multi-app kiosk on Windows 11 devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-11-to-specific-apps).

  For more information on dedicated kiosk devices in Intune, go to [Windows and Windows Holographic for Business device settings to run as a dedicated kiosk using Intune](../device-configuration/templates/configure-kiosk.md).
- Management capabilities to deliver customized Start and Taskbar experiences are currently limited. For more information, see the following articles:

  - [Supported configuration service provider (CSP) policies for Windows 11 Start menu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/supported-csp-start-menu-layout-windows)
  - [Supported configuration service provider (CSP) policies for Windows 11 taskbar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/supported-csp-taskbar-windows)
  - [Windows device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../device-configuration/templates/ref-device-restrictions-windows.md)

### Cloning physical and virtual devices

Intune does not support using a cloned image of a computer that is already enrolled. This includes both physical and virtual devices such as Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD). When device enrollment or identity tokens are replicated between devices, Intune device enrollment or synchronization failures will occur.

- For more information, see [Mobile device enrollment - Windows Client Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mobile-device-enrollment) and [Certificate authentication device enrollment - Windows Client Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/certificate-authentication-device-enrollment).
- For information on disabling token roaming in AVD, see [Using Azure Virtual Desktop multi-session with Microsoft Intune](../solutions/azure-virtual-desktop-multi-session.md#prerequisites).
- For information on troubleshooting issues related to image cloning, see [Error hr 0x8007064c: The machine is already enrolled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-windows-enrollment-errors#error-hr-0x8007064c-the-machine-is-already-enrolled).

### Supported platforms for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Integration

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on devices with Microsoft Intune](../device-security/microsoft-defender/security-settings-management.md)

### Supported Samsung Knox Standard devices

Microsoft Intune only attempts Samsung Knox activation during enrollment on supported Knox devices. Devices that don't support Samsung Knox enroll as standard Android devices. For a list of devices that support Samsung Knox, see [Devices secured by Knox](https://www.samsungknox.com/knox-supported-devices/knox-workspace) on the Samsung Knox website. It's important to look for your device model number when verifying support, because some device models support Knox while others don't. Always verify Knox compatibility with your device reseller before you buy and deploy Samsung devices.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You may need to enable access to Samsung servers to enroll Samsung Knox devices. For more information about enrollment, see [Automatically enroll Android devices by using Samsung's Knox Mobile Enrollment](../device-enrollment/android/setup-samsung-knox-mobile.md).

The Samsung device models in the following table don't support Knox solutions and features. Intune enrolls them as native Android devices.
