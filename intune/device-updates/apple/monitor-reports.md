# Software update reporting for Apple devices

Microsoft Intune uses Apple's declarative software update reporting model to provide near real-time status updates for managed Apple devices. This model enables Intune to surface update status directly from each device whenever its software update status changes.

## Prerequisites

![](../../media/icons/16/devices.svg) **Device platform requirements**

> Software update reporting for Apple devices in Intune requires the following platforms:
>
> - iOS/iPadOS 17.0 and later
> - macOS 14.0 and later

## View software update reports

Intune provides several reports to help you monitor and troubleshoot software updates across your Apple device fleet:

- **Summary report**: Shows a high-level view of update status across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS devices, including the most recently available update version and release date.  
   Intune checks with Apple once per day to identify newly available updates.
- **Organizational report**: Displays pending and current update details across all managed Apple devices.
- **Failures report**: Lists update failures across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS devices, including failure reasons and timestamps.
- **Per-device report**: Focuses on the update status for an individual device.

Select a tab to learn more about each report.

- [**Summary report**](#tabpanel_1_summary)
- [**Organizational report**](#tabpanel_1_organizational)
- [**Failures report**](#tabpanel_1_failures)
- [**Per-device report**](#tabpanel_1_per-device)

With the Apple software update **Summary** view, you can monitor details about pending and current software update status across your fleet of managed iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices.

This summary view presents the following information for each device platform:

- When you last refreshed the summary
- The latest update that's available for the platform
- When the latest update became available
- A chart view that identifies device counts for each software update status category

In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Reports** &gt; **Device management** &gt; **Apple updates** &gt; **Summary**.

- A chart view that identifies device counts for each software update status type
- A list of devices with their most recent update status, which includes the device name, platform, current OS version, pending OS version, and more

Intune per-device reports provide a software updates view that focuses on a single device.

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** &gt; select either **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS**, then select a device.
2. On the device **Overview** page, expand **Monitor** and then, depending on the type of device you're viewing, select the report:
   - For iOS and iPadOS, select **iOS software updates**.
   - For macOS, select **macOS software updates**.

In the per-device view, Intune displays the following information about the device's update status as reported by the device:

- Current OS version
- Current OS build
- Latest available update for this device
- Pending OS version
- Pending Build Version
- Install Reason
- Install State
- Last Reported Time - This value is the last time that the device synced with Intune.
